# CodebaseIndex Optimization & Best Practices Review

> **Note:** This file is now a historical archive. New items go in `docs/backlog.json`. Resolved items here are kept for context and commit references.

## Context

CodebaseIndex is a runtime-aware Rails codebase extraction system (~2,700 lines across 7 extractors). The extraction layer is complete and well-designed. This review identifies **29 items** across performance, security, correctness, coverage, and best practices — prioritized by impact. **Batches 1-4 fully resolved** (items #1-5, #7-11, #15-17) in commit `cab9061`. **Items #12-13 resolved** via shared AST layer (Prism-based `Ast::MethodExtractor` and `Ast::Parser`) in commit `30b6563`. Item #6 is partially resolved (86 gem specs + 87 integration specs; extractor-level fixture specs still needed).

## Critical: Performance

### 1. ✅ Git Data Extraction — N+1 Shell Commands — RESOLVED
**Files:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb:191-247`
**Resolution:** Replaced per-file subprocess spawns with `batch_git_data` — two git commands total (`git log --all --name-only` + parsing). Commit `cab9061`.

~~Currently spawns **6-7 shell processes per unit file** (`git log`, `git rev-list`, `git shortlog`). For a codebase with 200 units, that's ~1,400 subprocess spawns — easily the biggest bottleneck.~~

### 2. ✅ Repeated File Reads Within Each Extractor — RESOLVED
**Files:** All 7 extractors
**Resolution:** Each extractor now reads source once and passes the string through all methods. Commit `cab9061`.

~~Each extractor reads the same file 3-5 times during a single extraction.~~

### 3. ✅ O(n^2) Model Name Scanning in Dependency Extraction — RESOLVED
**Files:** All extractors
**Resolution:** `ModelNameCache` precomputes model names and builds a single compiled regex shared across all extractors. Commit `cab9061`.

~~Every extractor iterates all `ActiveRecord::Base.descendants` for every unit to find model name references.~~

### 4. ✅ O(n) Linear `find_unit` in Dependency Resolution — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** `resolve_dependents` now builds a `{ identifier => unit }` hash via `index_by` before the loop. Commit `cab9061`.

~~`resolve_dependents` calls `find_unit` (linear scan) for every dependency of every unit.~~

---

## Critical: Security

### 5. ✅ Shell Injection in Git Commands — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb:195-197, 214, 224, 235-238`
**Resolution:** Backtick git commands replaced with `Open3.capture2` argument arrays. No shell interpretation, no injection risk.

~~File paths were string-interpolated into backtick shell commands. A file path containing `"$(rm -rf /)` or backticks would execute arbitrary commands.~~

---

## Critical: Missing Fundamentals

### 6. 🔶 Test Suite — PARTIALLY RESOLVED
**Status:** 86 unit specs in the gem (`spec/`) + 87 integration specs in the test app (`test_app/spec/`). Unit-level coverage for core value objects, graph analysis, ModelNameCache, and json_serialize. Integration coverage for full extraction pipeline, incremental extraction, `:via` assertions, `_index.json` regeneration, git metadata structure, and `pretty_json` config.

**Remaining:** Extractor-level specs against fixture Rails apps are still needed. Priority areas:
- Individual extractors with fixture classes (requires a booted Rails environment)
- Edge cases: empty files, namespaced classes, STI, concern inlining

---

## High: Correctness Bugs

### 7. ✅ DependencyGraph Key Mismatch After JSON Round-Trip — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/dependency_graph.rb`
**Resolution:** `from_h` now uses `symbolize_node` and `transform_keys` to ensure symbol keys after JSON deserialization. `units_of_type(:model)` works correctly after round-trip.

~~`@type_index` used symbol keys (`:model`) during extraction, but `from_h` loaded string keys from JSON.~~

### 8. ✅ Incremental Extraction Doesn't Update Index Files — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** `extract_changed` now tracks `affected_types` and calls `regenerate_type_index` for each. Commit `cab9061`.

~~`extract_changed` re-writes individual unit JSON files and the dependency graph, but skips `_index.json` files.~~

### 9. ✅ Inconsistent `:via` Key in Dependencies — RESOLVED
**Resolution:** All extractors now include `:via` key (`:association`, `:code_reference`) consistently. Commit `cab9061`.

~~Model extractor includes `:via`, but controller, service, job, and mailer extractors omit it.~~

---

## High: Best Practices

### 10. ✅ Bare `rescue` Blocks — RESOLVED
**Files:** All extractors
**Resolution:** All bare `rescue` blocks changed to `rescue StandardError`. Critical exceptions (`SystemExit`, `SignalException`, `NoMemoryError`) now propagate correctly.

~~17+ instances of bare `rescue` across all extractors caught `Exception`, masking critical failures.~~

### 11. ✅ Repeated `eager_load!` Calls — RESOLVED
**Files:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb` (orchestrator), all extractors
**Resolution:** `Rails.application.eager_load!` consolidated to the orchestrator. No longer called redundantly by each individual extractor.

~~Called 5 times when the orchestrator ran all extractors sequentially.~~

---

## Medium: Code Quality

### 12. ✅ Fragile Method Boundary Detection — RESOLVED
**Files:** `controller_extractor.rb`, `mailer_extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** Replaced `extract_action_source` indentation heuristics (`nesting_delta`, `neutralize_strings_and_comments`, `detect_heredoc_start`) with `Ast::MethodExtractor#extract_method_source` — Prism-based AST parsing with exact line spans. Deleted ~190 lines of heuristic code across both files. Commit `30b6563`.

~~Uses indentation heuristics to find method `end`. Fails for multi-line signatures, `rescue`/`ensure` blocks, heredocs containing `end`.~~

### 13. ✅ Fragile Scope Extraction Regex — RESOLVED
**File:** `model_extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** Replaced `extract_scope_source` regex with `Ast::Parser`-based scope extraction. Parses full source, finds `:send` nodes with `method_name == 'scope'`, uses `line`/`end_line` spans for boundaries. Regex fallback retained for parse failures. Deleted `scope_keyword_delta` and `neutralize_strings_and_comments`. Commit `30b6563`.

~~Regex breaks on multi-line lambda bodies, nested blocks, scopes with comments inside, and `Proc.new` syntax.~~

### 14. ✅ Concern Detection Heuristic — RESOLVED
**File:** `model_extractor.rb:176-197`
**Resolution:** Improved concern detection to check module source location first (cheaper), with method-level checks as fallback. Filters out third-party gem concerns more reliably.

~~`mod.name.include?("Concerns")` matches any module with "Concerns" in its name, including third-party gems. `defined_in_app?` iterates all instance methods checking source locations (expensive).~~

### 15. ✅ Redundant `extract_public_api`/`extract_dsl_methods` Calls — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractors/rails_source_extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** `rate_importance` now receives pre-computed metadata instead of re-extracting. Commit `cab9061`.

~~`rate_importance` calls `extract_public_api(source)` and `extract_dsl_methods(source)` even though the same data was just computed.~~

### 16. ✅ `JSON.pretty_generate` for All Output — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** Added `config.pretty_json` (defaults to `true` for backward compat). `json_serialize` dispatches to `pretty_generate` or `generate` based on config. Commit `cab9061`.

~~Pretty-printed JSON adds ~30-40% size overhead from whitespace.~~

---

## Low: Minor Improvements

### 17. ✅ Cache `git_available?` Result — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** Memoized with `defined?(@git_available)` guard. Commit `cab9061`.

~~Spawns a subprocess every time it's called.~~

### 18. ✅ Memoize `estimated_tokens` — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extracted_unit.rb`
**Resolution:** Memoized with `@estimated_tokens ||=`. Safe because `source_code` is set once during extraction.

~~Recalculates on every call.~~

### 19. ✅ Use Set for Job Deduplication — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractors/job_extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** Replaced O(n) `units.any?` with a `Set` of seen identifiers for O(1) lookup.

~~`units.any? { |u| u.identifier == job_class.name }` is O(n) per check.~~

### 20. ✅ Configuration Validation — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index.rb:35-58`
**Resolution:** Added `validate!` method with checks for positive integers, valid ranges, and writable paths. Called before extraction runs.

~~No validation on `max_context_tokens`, `similarity_threshold`, `output_dir`, etc.~~

### 21. Token Estimation Accuracy
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extracted_unit.rb:66-69`

`(length / 4.0).ceil` is a rough heuristic. Ruby code tokenizes differently than natural language.

**Fix:** Consider `tiktoken_ruby` gem for accurate token counting, with the 4-char heuristic as fallback.

### 22. No Concurrent Extraction
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb:62-76`

Extractors run sequentially but are independent.

**Fix:** Use `Concurrent::Promises` or `Thread.new` with `Queue` for parallel extraction. Guard with a config flag.

### 23. ✅ Missing Mailer/Job Types in `re_extract_unit` — RESOLVED
**File:** `lib/codebase_index/extractor.rb`
**Resolution:** `re_extract_unit` now uses `TYPE_TO_EXTRACTOR_KEY` mapping and handles all types including `:job`, `:mailer`, and GraphQL types. Commit `cab9061`.

~~The `case` statement for re-extraction only handles `:model`, `:controller`, `:service`, `:component`.~~

---

## New: Extraction Coverage Gaps

### 24. ✅ No Serializer/Decorator Extractor — RESOLVED
**Resolution:** Added `SerializerExtractor` covering ActiveModelSerializers, Blueprinter, Alba, and Draper. Auto-detects loaded gems and extracts accordingly. Includes dependency tracking to underlying models.

~~No extractor exists for serializer or decorator patterns.~~

### 25. ✅ No ViewComponent Extractor — RESOLVED
**Resolution:** Added `ViewComponentExtractor` for `ViewComponent::Base` descendants. Extracts component slots, template paths, preview classes, and collection support. Registered alongside Phlex extractor.

~~Only Phlex view components are extracted.~~

---

## New: Documentation & Design Drift

### 26. ✅ Voyage Code 2 → Code 3 in Doc Examples — RESOLVED
**Resolution:** Updated all docs to lead with Voyage Code 3 (1024 dims, 32K context). Code 2 retained as legacy option where referenced. Cost figures updated across BACKEND_MATRIX.md, RETRIEVAL_ARCHITECTURE.md, and CONTEXT_AND_CHUNKING.md.

~~All embedding model references in docs still reference Voyage Code 2.~~

### 27. ✅ Scale Assumptions Outdated Throughout Docs — RESOLVED
**Resolution:** Updated prose references from "300" to "993"/"~1,000" across BACKEND_MATRIX.md and other docs. Cost projections recalculated for 1000-unit baseline. Tabular data retained at varying sizes (50-1000) for comparison.

~~Docs reference "300+ models" as the scale target.~~

---

## New: Retrieval Pipeline Gaps

### 28. ✅ RRF Should Replace Ad-Hoc Score Fusion — RESOLVED
**Resolution:** Replaced `merge_candidates` in RETRIEVAL_ARCHITECTURE.md with Reciprocal Rank Fusion (RRF) implementation: `score(d) = Σ 1/(k + rank_i(d))` with k=60. Eliminates need for cross-backend score normalization.

~~`HybridSearch` uses ad-hoc weighted score fusion.~~

### 29. ✅ Cross-Encoder Reranking Missing from Ranking Pipeline — RESOLVED
**Resolution:** Added cross-encoder reranking section to RETRIEVAL_ARCHITECTURE.md as an optional stage between initial ranking and context assembly. Defined `Reranker::Interface`, documented Cohere Rerank and Voyage Reranker as candidates, with configuration for enabling/disabling.

~~The retrieval pipeline has no reranking stage.~~

## New: MCP Index Server

Items identified from the initial MCP server implementation (commits `baa5b85`..`6e4de8f`) and real-world testing against a production Rails app.

### 30. ✅ MCP Index Server — Semantic Search Tool — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** `codebase_retrieve` tool implemented in MCP index server with auto-classification, token budgeting, and relevance scoring.

~~The index server currently has keyword regex search only (`search` tool). The AGENTIC_STRATEGY.md defines a `codebase_retrieve` tool for semantic search with auto-classification, token budgeting, and relevance scoring. This requires the embedding pipeline (Phase 1 of PROPOSAL.md) to be built first.~~

### 31. ✅ MCP Index Server — Framework Source Tool — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** `framework` tool implemented in MCP index server. Filters `rails_source` type units by concept keyword.

~~The `codebase_framework` tool from AGENTIC_STRATEGY.md (retrieve version-pinned Rails/gem source by concept) is not yet implemented.~~

### 32. ✅ MCP Index Server — Recent Changes Tool — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** `recent_changes` tool implemented in MCP index server. Sorts units by `metadata.git.last_modified` and returns most recently changed.

~~The `codebase_recent_changes` tool from AGENTIC_STRATEGY.md is not implemented.~~

### 33. MCP Index Server — HTTP Transport

The server only supports stdio transport. AGENTIC_STRATEGY.md mentions HTTP/Rack mode for network-accessible retrieval. Useful for shared team access or CI integration.

**Depends on:** Evaluation of whether `mcp` gem supports HTTP transport, or if a Rack wrapper is needed.

### 34. ✅ MCP Index Server — Resource Templates for Unit Lookup — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** `codebase://unit/{identifier}` and `codebase://type/{type}` resource templates implemented in MCP index server.

~~Currently only two static resources exist. Parameterized resources would let clients browse units through the resource interface.~~

---

## New: Console MCP Server

Implementation items from the CONSOLE_SERVER.md design document, organized by phase.

### 35. ✅ Console Server — Phase 0: Bridge Protocol — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** Bridge protocol implemented in `lib/codebase_index/console/bridge.rb`, connection manager in `lib/codebase_index/console/connection_manager.rb`, model validation in `lib/codebase_index/console/model_validator.rb`.

~~Build the JSON-lines bridge script (`lib/codebase_index/console/bridge.rb`) that boots Rails, validates models/columns against `ActiveRecord::Base.descendants`, and dispatches structured requests. Implement connection manager with Docker exec, direct, and SSH modes.~~

~~**Deliverables:** Bridge script, connection manager, heartbeat/reconnect, model validation allowlist.~~

### 36. ✅ Console Server — Phase 1: MVP Tools — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** 9 Tier 1 tools in `lib/codebase_index/console/tools/tier1.rb`, SafeContext in `lib/codebase_index/console/safe_context.rb`, console server executable at `exe/codebase-console-mcp`.

~~Implement Tier 1 tools: `count`, `sample`, `find`, `pluck`, `aggregate`, `association_count`, `schema`, `recent`, `console_status`. Wire up safety layers 1-4 (read-only connection, transaction rollback, statement timeout, structured validation). Add column redaction and result size caps.~~

~~**Deliverables:** `exe/codebase-console-mcp`, 9 Tier 1 tools, safety layers.~~
~~**Depends on:** #35~~

### 37. ✅ Console Server — Phase 2: Domain-Aware Tools + Controlled Writes — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** 9 Tier 2 tools in `lib/codebase_index/console/tools/tier2.rb`, class discovery for managers/policies/validators/decorators.

~~Implement Tier 2 tools: `diagnose_model`, `data_snapshot`, `validate_record`, `check_setting`, `update_setting`, `check_policy`, `validate_with`, `check_eligibility`, `decorate`. Add registered write actions with human confirmation (safety layer 5). Add auto-detection for managers, policies, validators, decorators from conventional directories.~~

~~**Deliverables:** 9 Tier 2 tools, write action registry, class discovery, preset configurations.~~
~~**Depends on:** #36~~

### 38. ✅ Console Server — Phase 3: Job Queue, Cache, and Analytics Tools — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** 10 Tier 3 tools in `lib/codebase_index/console/tools/tier3.rb`, job adapters (Sidekiq, Solid Queue, GoodJob) in `lib/codebase_index/console/adapters/`, cache adapter in `lib/codebase_index/console/adapters/cache_adapter.rb`.

~~Implement Tier 3 tools: `job_queues`, `job_failures`, `job_find`, `job_schedule`, `redis_info`, `cache_stats`, `slow_endpoints`, `error_rates`, `throughput`, `channel_status`. Build adapters for Sidekiq (Redis API), Solid Queue (DB tables), GoodJob (DB tables). Build cache adapters for Redis, Solid Cache, memory/file stores.~~

~~**Deliverables:** 10 Tier 3 tools, job backend adapters, cache backend adapters.~~
~~**Depends on:** #36~~

### 39. ✅ Console Server — Phase 4: Guarded Eval + Advanced Queries — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** 3 Tier 4 tools in `lib/codebase_index/console/tools/tier4.rb`, SQL validator in `lib/codebase_index/console/sql_validator.rb`, audit logger in `lib/codebase_index/console/audit_logger.rb`.

~~Implement Tier 4 tools: `console_eval` (human-approved), `console_sql` (read-only validated), `console_query` (structured builder). Add SQL statement validation (reject DML/DDL), human confirmation flow, audit logging.~~

~~**Deliverables:** 3 Tier 4 tools, statement validator, audit log.~~
~~**Depends on:** #36~~

### 40. Console Server — Amplitude Analytics Integration

Requested: add Amplitude as an analytics provider for Tier 3 tools. Amplitude's event and cohort data maps to `throughput` and `data_snapshot` tool patterns. Requires a provider adapter interface and Amplitude API client.

**Depends on:** #38, Amplitude API key and event schema from client app.

### 41. ✅ Extraction — Manager/Delegator Extractor — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** `manager_extractor.rb` implemented with spec. Scans `app/managers/`, detects `SimpleDelegator` ancestors, captures wrapped model, public methods, and delegation chain.

~~The admin app uses SimpleDelegator subclasses in `app/managers/` for account-scoped domain logic. Not covered by any existing extractor.~~

### 42. ✅ Extraction — Policy Class Extractor — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** `policy_extractor.rb` implemented with spec. Scans `app/policies/`, captures policy names, evaluated models, and decision methods.

~~Domain policy classes in `app/policies/` encapsulate business eligibility rules. Not covered by any existing extractor.~~

### 43. ✅ Extraction — Standalone Validator Extractor — RESOLVED

**Resolution:** `validator_extractor.rb` implemented with spec. Scans `app/validators/`, captures validator names, operated models, and validation rules.

~~Custom validator classes in `app/validators/` contain domain-specific validation logic that spans multiple models.~~

## Verification

After each batch:
1. Run `rake codebase_index:extract` on a real Rails app
2. Run `rake codebase_index:validate` to verify output integrity
3. Compare output JSON files before/after (should be identical except for timing fields)
4. Run `rake codebase_index:incremental` with a known changed file
5. Verify `_index.json` and `SUMMARY.md` are consistent with unit files
